## Project Configuration
This project relies on the tidyverse library.
A bug introduced to [`slice_sample()`](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/6185)
means we need to use an old version of `dplyr`. Install the correct version with:

```{r dplyr, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/dplyr@v1.0.7")
```

Other tidyverse packages are as listed below.
```{r tidyverse}
library(tidyverse)
```

This project is built using the `targets` and `future` libraries.

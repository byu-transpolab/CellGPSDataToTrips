abstract: |
  DBSCAN Entropy algorithms appear to be the most accurate way to process the GPS data into trips/activities. This algorithm takes
  four parameters to work: minimum number of points (minpts), radius for those points (eps), entropy threshold (entr_t),
  and a time difference threshold (delta_t). While there are lots of studies that explain ways to
  determine minpts, eps, and entr_t, information lacks deciding on
  an accurate delta_t parameter. This paper explains one method of how to choose an adequate delta_t parameter: implement a DBSCAN Entropy algorithm in R alongside raw GPS data maps to use for comparison.

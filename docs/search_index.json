Despite GPS devices ability to record time and positional characteristics, they still require processing in order to convert the positional characteristics into trip purposes and activities. The first step of this conversion process is cleaning the GPS data to produce trips. Currently, most researchers use subjective time and speed rule-based algorithms to perform this task (Shen and Stopher 2014). Due to their ambiguity, using these rules is not ideal. For example, some people walk slower than others, so the speed threshold would require constant manual changing. Another issue with these rules is that every researcher must have their own definition of a trip. One researcher who considers picking somebody up to be its own activity will have a significantly smaller time threshold. Due to GPS data imputation being applied in these different contexts, accuracy ranges from 43% to 61% (Shen and Stopher 2014). The newest and second most common method is cluster-based: the density of GPS points within a predefined radius determines an activity. The radius and point density would not vary from person to person thus providing increased efficiency and precision. In fact, one experiment using a DBSCAN cluster-based algorithms proved to be 92% precise (Luo et al. 2017). Despite this impressive precision, three main gaps still remain: survey collection typically doesnt exceed two weeks (Feng and Timmermans 2016), not all activities are accounted for in analysis, and this algorithm has not been published in R. Usually, researchers group all of the Other trip purposes into one category and analyze it as a whole (Elevelt et al. 2021). Therefore, the question I am answering is: How does one write a cluster-based algorithm in R that accurately transforms 6+ months worth of GPS survey data into trips and analyze the Other trip purposes as separate activities? The respondents GPS data used in my code is associated with their responses to mental health surveys, so they are not publicly available. However, they will be generally described in the Methods section.

This usually involves a discussion about both the data you used and the models you applied. 2.1 Data Discuss where you got your data, how you cleaned it, any assumptions you made. data(&quot;Car&quot;, package = &quot;mlogit&quot;) car_mlogit &lt;- Car %&gt;% mutate(choice = gsub(&quot;choice&quot;, &quot;&quot;, choice)) %&gt;% dfidx( varying = 5:70, shape = &quot;wide&quot;, choice = &quot;choice&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot;) Often there will be a table describing summary statistics of your dataset. Table 2.1 shows a nice table using the datasummary functions in the modelsummary package. datasummary_balance( ~type, data = car_mlogit %&gt;% select(type, fuel, price, range, size), dinm = FALSE, title = &quot;Descriptive Statistics of Dataset&quot; ) Table 2.1: Descriptive Statistics of Dataset regcar (N=10930) sportuv (N=1048) sportcar (N=880) stwagon (N=4446) truck (N=5628) van (N=4992) Mean Std.

But this is where you describe the mathematical construction of your model, the variables it uses, and other things. Some methods are so common (linear regression) that it is unnecessary to explore them in detail. But others will need to be described, often with mathematics. For example, the probability of a multinomial logit model is \\[\\begin{equation} P_i(X_{in}) = \\frac{e^{X_{in}\\beta_i}}{\\sum_{j \\in J}e^{X_{jn}\\beta_j}} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] Use LaTeX mathematics. Youll want to number display equations so that you can refer to them later in the manuscript. Other simpler math can be described inline, like saying that \\(i, j \\in J\\). Details on using equations in bookdown are available here. "],["findings.html", " 3 Findings 3.1 Additional Analysis", " 3 Findings This section might be called Results instead of Applications, depending on what it is that you are working on. But youll probably say something like The initial model estimation results are given in Table ??. That table is created with the modelsummary() package and function. model1 &lt;- mlogit(choice ~ type + price | -1, data = car_mlogit) model2 &lt;- update(model1, .~. + range) models &lt;- list(&quot;Model 1&quot; = model1, &quot;Model 2&quot; = model2) With those results presented, you can go into a discussion of what they mean. first, discuss the actual results that are shown in the table, and then any interesting or unintuitive observations. 3.1 Additional Analysis Usually, it is good to use your model for something. Hypothetical policy analysis Statistical validation effort Equity or impact analysis If the analysis is substantial, it might become its own top-level section.

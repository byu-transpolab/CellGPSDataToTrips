# Question

Global Positioning System (GPS) surveys have become a more accurate and reputable alternative to previous travel survey methods that collect activity-travel patterns. Despite GPS devices' ability to record time and positional characteristics, further processing is required to determine the number of trips.

A DBSCAN algorithm (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is one of the most accurate ways to process GPS data because it "overcome[s] some inherent limitations of partitioning and hierarchical algorithms"[@DBSCANWeb2019]. In fact, one experiment [@DBAlgorithm2017] using just a DBSCAN cluster-based algorithms proved to be 92% precise which is significantly better than the typical 43% to 61% reported from using rule-based algorithms [@reviewOfMethods2014].

If one wishes to remove error even further, entropy (the chaotic movement betwen points in a cluster) can be added to the DBSCAN algorithm as done by Gong et al. in 2018 ([@GongInspiration]). Including entropy removes inaccuracies that come from situations like a stoplight being mistaken as its own trip. 

For a DBSCAN-Entropy Algorithm to work, four parameters are required: minimum number of points to be considered a cluster (minpts), radius in which those minpts can occur in (eps), the entropy threshold (entr_t), and the time threshold in which one trip is considered two trips at the same location (delta_t).

One common way to select the minpts and radius (eps) thresholds is to arbitrarily pick the minpts based on how large the data set is (with a minimum of three) and then set k = minPts in a k-distance plot [@RKNNMethod2018] to find eps. Unfortunately, this method only works in a pure DBSCAN algorithm where only minpts and eps are accounted for, not entr_t and delta_t. Gong et al. (2018) was able to determine an accurate entr_t threshold: . However, delta_t is still arbitrarily chosen and not as much research or experiments have been done to determine an accurate delta_t.

Hence, the purpose of this paper is to explore a method of how to select an accurate delta_t parameter to use in a DBSCAN-Entropy Algorithm while keeping the other three parameters constant.
